## Replicating this project

**Option 1 (Reccomended):** Click the above "Open In Colab" badge (or upload notebook to Colab) and run in a **GPU** instance. Run All. 

**Option 2:** Upload jupyer notebook to another GPU enabled jupyter environment and run all cells. 

*This project can run on CPU but evaluation will be VERY slow*
